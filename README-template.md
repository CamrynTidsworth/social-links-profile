## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I realized I could position my main container by formatting the body with flexbox, instead of adding an extra div to act as a wrapper. This simplified my code and helped me get a stronger grasp on flexbox. 

### Continued development

I feel comfortable with all the concepts used in this project. My next goal is to apply these concepts (CSS variables, flexbox positioning, etc.) to a more complex web page.
